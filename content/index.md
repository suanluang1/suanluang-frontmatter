## Thailand's Largest Botanical Garden

Suanluang Rama IX, also referred to as King Rama IX Park, is Bangkok's largest public park spanning 500 rai (80 hectares) in the Prawet District. Established in 1987 to commemorate King Bhumibol Adulyadej's (Rama IX) 60th birthday, this botanical paradise was officially opened by the King himself on December 1, 1987.

Suanluang Rama IX is a living tribute to the late King's dedication to environmental conservation and botanical research. The park features extensive botanical gardens, international-themed gardens, a serene lake, and pavilions showcasing the King's environmental initiatives.
